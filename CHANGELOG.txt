1.0.5:
-Added: Config Option to control max height of loaded chunk indicator - SHOULD FIX INTENSE LAG, TOO.
-Fixed (MAJOR): Chunk Loaders not releasing their Tickets when broken.
-Fixed (MAYBE): Supposed corruption (unconfirmed, never got logs / bug reports) on worlds when closing. Maybe. Not sure what caused it to begin with.
-Changed: ModID to all lower case internally. Doesn't make a single difference to end user. 1.11-proofing, mostly.
-Changed: Refactors and JavaDoc - doesn't affect the end user either.
1.0.4:
-Added: Right Click now shows chunks that are loaded (this is client-side only)
1.0.3:
-Fixed: ClassCastException causing the internal server to stop responding
1.0.2:
-Fixed: NullPointerException causing world load to hang
1.0.1:
-Fixed: ConcurrentModificationException causing Chunk Loaders to disappear when broken
1.0.0:
-I think this mod is finally at a 1.0 (non-alpha and non-beta stage)
-Added: Chunk Loaders now automatically load themselves on world load. You will need to re-place chunk loaders that have already been placed before this will work.
