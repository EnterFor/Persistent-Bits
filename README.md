7 x 7 Chunk Loading in Minecraft

TODO:
- [ ] Maybe make chunk loading radius configurable? Will need to stop and think about calculations for that if I do, not a big deal, I just hate to math >_<

- [ ] Maybe make tiered chunk loading / expandable chunk loading via Right-Click of specified items? Shetiphian has gotten to me!!
